## Structure

**[Swagger Round](/figures#swagger-round)**:
Outside foot; ends with galley up.  Must be done quickly, more like skipping than usual, in order for 7 and 8 to be in line for the galley.

**[Heading Up](/figures#heading-up)**:
Outside foot; 4 double steps, swingbacks, galley up

**Chorus**

**[Heading Down](/figures#heading-down)**:
Inside foot; 4 double steps, swingbacks, galley down

**Chorus**

**[Back to Back](/figures#back-to-back)**:
[castlering foot](/figures#castlering-foot); galley away

**Chorus**

**[Hey](/figures#hey)**:
[castlering foot](/figures#castlering-foot); galley at end toward castlering foot (see below), passing left shoulders

**Chorus**

## Chorus

Main Idea: Go into the center and form a circle facing in this order (1) ends (2) sides (3) everyone. <br>
Each of the 4 choruses has a different component, in this order (1) tarzans (2) Lichfield caper (3) scissor caper (4) castlering caper

Start chorus with castlering foot

2 capers (except first chorus, with tarzans--see below), according to order above<br>
Galley away (square facing in towards your partner, end facing out, galley directly up or down the set)<br>
4 plain capers back to place<br>

First chorus: 4 Tarzans instead of 2 capers: beat chest once as you step on the beat, use opposite arm from foot.  Start with castlering foot.   

## Ending

At end of last chorus, use plain capers to come back to place facing up.

## Notes

Which way do you galley on the hey?

Ends face in, middles face out when you land the galley.  Pass left with your partner.  This can be described as galleying in the direction of your castle-ring foot (right for 2,4, 5,7; left for 1,3,6,8)

In detail: start by facing your partner, then square as follows:
1,2,7,8: Square out (i.e. facing up for 1,2 and down for 7,8) so that you land facing into the set
3,4,5,6: Square facing in so that you land facing out
