## Chorus
Main Idea: Sticking in X formation with crossings

**Fight Sticking**: 1+3, 2+4, 5+7, 6+8 do clashes:

Forehand clash low
Backhand clash low
Forehand clash high (and outsides start moving out to X formation)
Backhand clash high (outsides keep moving out)
Take stick in both hands with left hand high and clash, while taking one step out along X, as if insides are pushing outside.
Repeat two-hand clash with right side high
Wind up
Big forehand clash high

**Crossing and Sticking**:

First Corners Cross: cross right shoulders with corner pair, double stepping

Second Corners Stick: Hold stick in middle of R hand.

Swing stick back and strike ground with tip.
Bring stick back up
Clash butts backhand
Clash tips forehand

Then repeat, with second corners crossing and first corners sticking

**Swagger Home**:

Single Step back to place like end of Swagger Round, with 1 and 2 leading the way (then 3 and 4, then 5 and 6, then 7 and 8).  Cross left shoulders (like end of swagger round).  End with Clash.

## Ending

Last chorus: On “Crossing and Sticking,” instead of taking turns, everybody starts with sticking.  Then everybody crosses.  Insides meet in the middle passing by the others on their right shoulder, then outsides meet in the middle, too.  Outsides will be running a little late, especially 7 and 8, so they should cut the crossing short and start single stepping right away to get back in time to end with a clash, facing up with sticks crossed, holding stick in one hand.
