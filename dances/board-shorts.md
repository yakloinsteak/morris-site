title: Board Shorts
history: |
  Created by Windham during a lean year, when we’d often have few dancers at
  practices and gigs.  We adapted many dances of our 8-person dances for 4, and
  this is one that worked well and became a favorite for its own sake.  It is
  based on the chorus of Jean Boardman’s Cakes and the figures of Max Headroom.

## Structure

Hanky dance, lined up in a “vertical line” with 1 up and 4 down, all facing up.

Musicians play once to themselves.

**Step in Line**: A simple adaptation of the 8-person
[Step in Line](/figures#step-in-line).  2 double steps in place, galley, 2
double steps in place, galley back home, end facing in to start chorus.

Which way do you galley? 1 and 3 galley L first, 2 and 4 galley R first.

**Chorus**


**Heading Up**

The line is half-way between the front and back. See å for what we used to do.

**Chorus**

**Heading Down**

The line is half-way between the front and back. See ض for what we used to do.

**Chorus**

**[Doubling Up](/figures#doubling-up)**: Like 8-person doubling up, but just
one line.  End facing in for chorus.

**Chorus**: Last chorus, end in “horizontal line”, going to these places after
the “clump” in the middle instead of going home:

Up
```
1  2  3  4
```
Down

End facing up.

## Chorus

Main Idea: Swirling to Clump, Swirling and Galley Home

**Swirling to Clump**: Middle and Ends have different parts for first 4 double steps:
Middles: pass by right shoulders, but then turn right and come back at roughly 4 or 5 o-clock (or maybe just 3?) relative to starting orientation, then turn left and loop back to join a small circle/clump in the middle

Ends: wait one double step, then go straight through to other side, turn left
and and loop back to join a small circle/clump in the middle

Positions at end of 4th double step, facing in toward each other:

Up
```
4    2

3    1
```
Down

**Swirling and Galley Home**: In 2 double steps, everyone will travel
counterclockwise to arrive at these positions (“one spot from home”):

Up
```
2
1
4
3
```
Down

Then square with left shoulder toward home, and galley left home, passing “left
shoulders” with partner, so you land the galley facing each other before
capering back to place, usually facing in to be ready for the next figure.

## Notes

Ending: on last chorus, from the clump, travel counterclockwise to these
positions in two doublesteps, then end facing up with plain capes in place

1  3  2   4

## Previous Figures We've Retired From This Dance

**å Hey** We used to do the Hey instead of heading up. Double stepping, middles
start crossing by right shoulder (while ends do first double step in place,
before heading off to their own right (before coming back left to cross right
shoulders in the middle).  In general, cross right shoulders in the middle, do
a big counterclockwise loop on ends.

At end, stop one place from home, and then galley left towards home, crossing
left shoulders with partner. End facing in for chorus.

**ض Max Rounds**: Main Idea: Travel in a big circle clockwise, turn around and
travel counterclockwise, galley home.

2 double steps and then a galley L in clockwise circle.  Ends start moving 90
degrees toward left (as in circle's tangent), and middle move at about 45
degrees, between forward and left.  To do galley, square in, and galley left
along the line of the circle.  With practice, one can move smoothly into the
galley from the double steps so it happens with a leaping/running transition
instead of a stop.  In general, folks get a little less than halfway around
the circle (ends don't quite make it to the opposite end).  Use the capers
from the galley to face clockwise.

2 double steps back counterclockwise around circle, then galley home.  For
this galley, middles square out-ish and then galley L toward their home
position, while ends square in and galley R around the circle toward home.
Ends facing in for chorus.
