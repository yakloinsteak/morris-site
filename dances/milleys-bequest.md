title: "Milley's Bequest"
history: Traditional.  Acoording to [tunearch.org](https://tunearch.org/wiki/Annotation:Milley%27s_Bequest), the title is a reference to a bequest made in the fifteenth century by Cannon Thomas Milley. Lichfield had, since 1424, a women's almshouse near Lichfield Catherdral for the care of the poor and infirm. In 1504 Milley re-endowed it "with tenements and lands producing, together with subsequent benefactions, an income of about ₤370, for the maintenance of fifteen aged women, who receive each a weekly allowance of seventeen shillings and sixpence...a dispensary, supported by subscription, was established in 1829" [Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of England, 1833]. The building is locally known as Dr. Milley's Hospital, and is still employed (albeit much renovated) as a charity for needy women.

## Chorus
Main Idea: Sticking like "Thou Shalt Not Pass", side steps, galley

Start with right foot

**Sticking**: Take 2 steps (on the beat), striking the ground with the stick at the same time as the step, and on the same side (R foot steps at same time that R stick hits ground).  Sticks remain vertical.  Try to keep body upright, not bent over, and look across at your partner.  Use those steps to approach your partner.  Note that this means it is OK to end figures very wide, since you have steps to come in.  This should be discussed and agreed on so the set finishes and approaches in nice lines

Then clash R with partner, and then L with partner, on the beat.

Repeat.  Second time, steps are in place, but try to add a nice bounce.

Hint: it can be helpful to choke up/down on the sticks so you're holding them toward the top when banging the ground but closer to the bottom when clashing with partner

**Side steps**: 2 open side steps, first to R.

**Galley Right**: ends with self-clash on beat 4

## Ending

Last chorus ends face up, with self clash on beat 4 (as usual), and loud "hey!"
