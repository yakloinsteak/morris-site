title: The Snow Moose 
history: Adapted from the Welsh Nantgarw tradition.  Windham learned of the tradition and dance in 2022, and began learning the dance based on [Cardiff Morris's 2014 video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRNFF0_Jqok).  The name of the dance (which sometimes appears with "Caseg") means "The Snow Mare," which is apparently a Welsh idiom for a large snowball.  The "scooping" figures in the dance are reminiscent of creating a large snowball, and the cross-body hanky showing is reminiscent of hugging oneself in the cold.  Windham was motivated to learn Nantgarw in part because of possible connections to to Lichfield, including 8 dancer sets.  What we know about all this comes from [Cardiff Morris](http://www.cardiffmorris.org/Nantgarw.htm) and [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_dance#Morris_Dancing_in_Wales).  It is worth noting that, according to Wikipedia, "There are no hard and fast rules as to which Morris sides can perform dances from a tradition, but the original Nantgarw dance, Y Gaseg Eira, is considered to be a dance for the Welsh sides." Windham adapted the dance to make it easier for us to remember and closer in style to our other dances; these changes led to others, resulting in a quite different version.

  * On capers after galley, form a regular shaped set.  Most folks are in the right spot, but 3 and 4 need to slide back to their original positions.  3-6 will be in the right spots, 1-2 and 7-8 will be a long corner across from their original positions. 

**Corner Crossings**:

    * 4th double step: in place

```
    Up
8   4   7
5   3   6
 2    1
````
  * 1 and 2 do 8 scoops
  * At same time, 3-8 do 12 single steps with same-side hankies (start with R foot, R show)
    * 3-8 do 4 more single steps with same-side hankies, but 4 and 3 slide to form a regular set (with folks out of place).  4 slides between 6 and 7, 3 between 8 and 5.  See below for final positions

```
  Up
8   7
3   4
5   6
2   1
```

**Corner Crossings**:

  * 6 double steps

    * 1-2: 1 and 8 cross
    * 3-4: 2 and 7 cross (after this people are in original places)
    * 5-6: all face up

  * 4 capers turning CW ½ way
  * 2 double steps facing down
  * 4 capers turning CW ½ way

**Top Hey**:

  * 2 double steps

      * 1st: 1st corners cross
      * 2nd: 2nd corners cross

  * 4 capers turning CW to end in positions for hey:

  * Hey

      * While top 6 (original positions 1-4, 7-8) do hey, top 2 (original 5&6) stay in place, mostly doing single steps with cross-body hankies, alternating with 4 capers rotating.  However, when bottoms are crossing, top 2 double step instead of single step.
      * To start Hey, 2 at top turn out and then thread through the other two.  The middles start moving inward and up.  Bottoms turn the hard way and go out.
      * Do ½ Hey with 2 double steps, then do 4 capers turning around.

          * Everyone turns out, based on the way they are heading.

      * Repeat for 2nd half of the Hey (reversed: bottom 2 head out, middles head in and down)

  * Middles cross, starting with “1st corners” (original 2 and 7), 1 double step for each pair (this is when top 2 double step instead of single step)
  * 4 capers (CW)
  * Repeat Hey

**Bottom Hey**:

Repeat Hey (including corener crossings at start), but now top 2 stay in place and bottom 6 do the Hey, oriented the
same way (middles head up first). Note: after corner crossings at start of Hey, set should be reversed from original
positions (1 and 2 at bottom)

**Circle Hey**:

  * Weave around the circle for 6 double steps

    * 1st corners travel CW, 2nd travel CCW
    * 1st pass is by right shoulders
    * Should end in a circle version of original set.

  * On final 4 capers, caper to middle of circle


## Basic Steps

  * Double Steps (like Windham's)
  * Single Capers, with hankies in a low circle, like in Adderbury
  * Single steps

    * Cross-body hankies: arms alternating out (at roughly shoulder height) and across the body (both arms go out, then both arms cross the body)
    * Same-side hankies: arms alternate, showing up and a little out, on same side as landing foot

  * Scoops:

     * Arms scoop forward, ending with hands at shoulder height
     * Feet: forward on right, hop, back on left, hop

  * All corner crossings by R shoulder
