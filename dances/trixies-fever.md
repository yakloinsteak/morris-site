title: "Trixie's Fever"
history: |
    Written by Rafe Rosen and Windham, the seeds of this dance were planted when Tony Barrand sang verses to the American anthem "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" during a pub sing at McNeill's Brewery sometime in the early 2010's.  Following in the footsteps of the men's team of Marlboro Morris and Sword, who a generation before composed Lichfield dances to ubiquitous American songs like "Yankee Doodle" and "Popeye the Sailor Man," we pulled together choreography during our fall 2022 retreat and started performing it the following May.  We were also inspired by the Pinewoods Morris Men's "Casey at the Bat," which is danced to the same tune.  This dance celebrates many of our members' fondness for the National Pastime and features a leisurely double-length chorus that brings its performance time in at slightly less than a typical 9-inning game.

    While the chorus of "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" is a cornerstone of the American songbook, the verses that Barrand sang are less widely known yet reveal a stirring feminist sentiment within this early 20th century composition.  The song's protagonist is Katie Casey, a woman who uninhibitedly inhabits the traditionally male-dominated ballpark scene.  Preferring baseball games to attending the theater, she argues with umpires and rouses the crowd at a critical moment in the game.  As the opening verse declares:

    > Katie Casey was baseball mad,
    > Had the fever and had it bad.

    The inspiration for this heroine is believed to be the actress Trixie Friganza.  A famous performer on the vaudeville circuit, Friganza was also an outspoken suffragist when her boyfriend Jack Norwoth wrote the lyrics to "Take Me Out to the Ballgame" in 1908.  Speaking at a New York City suffrage rally that same year Friganza told the crowd "I do not believe any man – at least no man I know – is better fitted to form a political opinion than I am."

    It is Trixie Friganza and her fevered insistence on inclusion that we choose to remember in the title of our dance.
